## Project Title: Customer Behavior Analysis Using Machine Learning

### Introduction
This project aims to analyze customer behavior on an e-commerce platform by utilizing various machine learning techniques. By processing and analyzing user interaction data, we can derive valuable insights into how customers engage with products and the factors influencing their purchasing decisions. The focus is on understanding behaviors that lead to added items in the shopping cart, as well as identifying patterns that could help improve conversion rates.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model development using various classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Clustering techniques for customer segmentation
- Visualization of decision trees and model performance
- Shapley values and feature importance analysis

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Usage
- Load your data files into the appropriate directory.
- Open the notebook and follow the sections to preprocess data, train models, and analyze results.
- Visualizations will help you interpret model performance and customer behaviors.
